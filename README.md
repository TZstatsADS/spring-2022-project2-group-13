# Project 2: Shiny App Development

### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)

![screenshot](doc/figs/map.jpg)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on the work of a **NYC government agency/program** of your choice using NYC open data released on the [NYC Open Data By Agency](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/) website. In particular, many agencies have adjusted their work or rolled out new programs due to COVID, your app should provide ways for a user to explore quantiative measures of how covid has impacted daily life in NYC from different prospectives. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

## Project summary: 
	This shiny app is designed to analyze the change on mental health of people under Covid-19 pandemic, and reasons behind it. From the app, the users can find the unemployeement rate, income, and drug usage in the New York City. These factors are possible factors that influence people's mental health. Also, the results from a questionaire from National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) are also visualized to illustrate mental conditions before and after the pandemic. Combining these two analysis, the users can have a grasp on the mental health under pandemic.
